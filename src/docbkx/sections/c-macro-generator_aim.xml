      <title>Aim of the <emphasis>&productName;</emphasis> plugin</title>
      <para> The <emphasis>&productName;</emphasis> plugin provides an alternative code generation
        that does not rely on the Mind C preprocessor and thus does not modify the user source
        code.</para>
      <para>The <emphasis>&productName;</emphasis> plugin is able to produce the necessary glue to
        compile each primitive definition of an application in a set of object files, but cannot
        assemble those object files into an executable.</para>
      <para>The <emphasis>&productName;</emphasis> plugin is targeted to be combined with source
        code analysis tools, but does NOT fit to the task of releasing binaries, neither to execute
        or benchmark code size. </para>
